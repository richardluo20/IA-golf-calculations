# IA-golf-calculations
Program to calculate the path of a golf ball being putted.
Uses Euler's method of numerically solving differential equations in order to find the position, velocity and acceleration of a ball at time t given a function that describes the surface of a golf green. Based on simple multivariable/vector calculus (partial derivatives, gradient).
